# Surfs up weather data 

## Overview of Analysis: 

This project we were tasked with finding weather data for the Hawaii island Oahu. The reason that this data is needed is because W. Avy and ourselves want to open a suf and icecream shop on the island. We need money and backers for this though so in order to convince the board for the money, we needed to show them the Oahu is the perfect place weather wise to open this shop. Our analysis grabs the month of June and the month of December's min, max, and average temps to show if they are good temps for surfing and ice cream. 

## Results 

The results here are rather suprising. Below we have outlined what the min, max, and average temps are for June and December.

## Summary 

All in all, the tempatures for the island seem to be a great place to open up the ice cream and surf shop. With the max temps being in the 80's and and the median being in the 70's. There are two additional queries though that i would create. I would pull the percipitation data for the months of June and December. I would also pull how much percipitation there is for each month. This could be useful because although the temps for June and December are good, it might be nice to know if it rains a ton those months which would deter people from eating ice cream and surfing.
